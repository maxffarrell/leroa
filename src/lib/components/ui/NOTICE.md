# Vendored components

Components in this directory are vendored from two MIT-licensed registries rather
than installed as packages, so they can be adapted in place:

- **shadcn-svelte** — https://github.com/huntabyte/shadcn-svelte (MIT)
  Copyright (c) Huntabyte and contributors.
- **shadcn-svelte-extras** — https://github.com/ieedan/shadcn-svelte-extras (MIT)
  Copyright (c) Aidan Bleser and contributors.

Components sourced from shadcn-svelte-extras: `confirm-delete-dialog`,
`copy-button`, `file-drop-zone`, `modal`, `nlp-date-input` (if present),
`phone-input`, `split-button`, plus their shared helpers (`components/button.svelte`,
`hooks/use-clipboard.svelte.ts`). Everything else here is shadcn-svelte core,
including the chat components (`message`, `bubble`, `attachment`, `marker`).
